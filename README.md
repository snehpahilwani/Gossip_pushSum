# Project2

• Implemented Asynchronous Gossip Algorithm for group communication and Push-Sum algorithm for aggregate computation on different simulated network topologies (Full, Line, 2D Grid, Imperfect Grid) and determined the convergence of these algorithms. </br>
• Simulated upto 8000 nodes (Actors) in the network. </br>
• Technology used: Elixir
